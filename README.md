###  Website goals are below:

### Empower Learning

The primary goal of the website is to convey the startup's commitment to empowering learning 
through innovative technology solutions. Clearly articulate how the education technology 
offered enhances the learning experience for students, educators, and institutions.

###  Showcase Innovation

Highlight the innovative aspects of the education technology. Whether it's personalized 
learning paths, interactive content, or real-time feedback mechanisms, the website should 
emphasize how these features set the startup apart from traditional educational methods.

###  Educate and Inform

of integrating technology into education. Use clear and engaging language to ensure that 
even someone unfamiliar with the field can understand the value proposition.

achievements or partnerships. Include testimonials or case studies if available. This helps 
in building credibility among potential users, investors, and partners.

The tutorial demonstrates the choice of domain name and content management system, choosing WordPress
 for its ease of use. Additionally, the tutorial demonstrates the installation of the Elementor plugin in 
the WordPress dashboard to build a custom website. Content creation using Elementor is emphasized

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- During the above learning process, I gained insight into the complexity of creating websites and the 
  differences between different content management systems (CMS). The tutorial focuses on Joomla, highlighting 
  its user-friendliness and applicability, especially for the creation of websites and web applications. 
  Through a detailed account setup process, I realized that choosing the appropriate version is critical 
  to the performance and functionality of a website. Using the free version option was an affordable choice.

- The section on CMS selection, I learned how to weigh the choice of subdomain, domain, and type of CMS 
  when building a specific type of website. For me, the decision to choose WordPress over Joomla was
  based more on its ease of use and flexibility.

- By comparing the performance of different CMS versions and using Lighthouse reports, I learned key indicators
  for evaluating a site, including SEO, speed, and accessibility, etc. Joomla 5 scored higher than WordPress in terms 
  of performance, which gave me a clearer understanding of the performance differences between the different CMSs.

- Overall, the learning process was not just a journey of learning about website creation, but also thinking 
  about the future direction of my career. I have gained a clearer understanding of choosing the appropriate 
  CMS and tools, as well as recognizing that needs and preferences may vary for different types of websites.
  In the future, I look forward to applying this learned knowledge to real-world projects and furthering 
  my accomplishments in the field of web development.
